Question:
After running both simulations, what are the results do you see? How does each simulation differ in its average latency?

Answer:
After running both simulations, I notice that the wait time depends on the amount of servers. Sometimes it's longer or sometimes smaller. When we Add more servers, it cuts the average latency wait time.
